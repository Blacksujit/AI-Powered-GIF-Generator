# AI-Powered GIF Generator 🎨🔄

## Overview

Welcome to the AI-Powered GIF Generator! This innovative Python project transforms static images into captivating, stylized GIFs using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging the power of PyTorch and the Microsoft ResNet-50 model, this tool applies unique style transfers, rotations, and visual enhancements to create eye-catching animated GIFs.



## Features

- 🖼️ **User-Friendly Image Input**: Simply provide the path to your image file.
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Style Transfer**: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for sophisticated image styling.
- 🌀 **Dynamic Rotations**: Applies a full 360-degree rotation across frames for a mesmerizing effect.
- ✨ **Visual Enhancements**: Implements edge enhancement, brightness adjustment, and contrast improvement.
- 🎞️ **Smooth GIF Generation**: Creates a seamless animated GIF from the processed frames.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PIL (Pillow)
- imageio
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- transformers
- numpy

 

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python generate_gif.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter the path to your image file.

3. Wait for the magic to happen! The script will process your image and create an animated GIF.

4. Find your generated GIF in the `gif_generator/images/` directory.

## How It Works

1. **Image Loading**: The user provides the path to an image file.
2. **Frame Creation**: The script generates multiple frames, each with:
   - A unique rotation
   - AI-powered style transfer
   - Edge enhancement
   - Brightness and contrast adjustments
3. **GIF Compilation**: All frames are combined into a smooth, looping GIF.
